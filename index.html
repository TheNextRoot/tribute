<p class="text-justify">This tribute page is dedicated to my better half, Robert.  We were married in June 2011.  He's not only my husband, he's my best friend.  As is expected of any best friends, we do lots of things together.  We love to try new foods, watch re-runs of our favorite TV shows, take long walks in the park and make each other laugh.  Robert is originally from Baltimore City, Maryland.  He grew up with his dad, grandma-who he calls Mom because she practically raised him from birth- and his four uncles.  Life was never easy but he was taught some valuable life lessons that he still remembers to this day.  He learned the value of money by getting slapped for throwing away a penny (true story!)  He was also taught never to throw away food.  I guess that's what makes him a creative cook.  He'll always try to reinvent leftovers before tossing it in the trash.  He's kind-hearted, sensitive and thrives on feeling useful.  And, of course: he's a Ravens fan! </p>
